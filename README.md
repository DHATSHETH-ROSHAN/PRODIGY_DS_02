# DATA UNDERSTANDING
The datasets is obtained from Kaggle: Titanic

The dataset contains 891 rows (entries) and 12 columns
The columns are:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Binary variable indicating survival (1 = Survived, 0 = Did Not Survive).
Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd class).
Name: Passenger's name.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Passenger fare.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

# Insights and Conclusions
 % of people did not survive while 
 % percent survived.
There is a relatively smaller number of children (around 5-15 years old) and elderly passengers (above 60 years old) on the Titanic
Passengers in Class 1 had a higher chance of survival compared to those in Class 2 and Class 3. This suggests that the passenger class might have influenced the survival rate
Class 3 had the highest number of passengers but the lowest survival rate, indicating a potential class-based hierarchy in rescue efforts
Survived and Fare: There is a positive correlation between "Survived" and "Fare," suggesting that passengers who paid higher fares had a higher chance of survival.
Age vs. Survived: there might be a slight concentration of younger survivors.
